/*Coding Challenge #1
Mark and john are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is 
calculated using the formula:
BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg 
and height in meter).
Your tasks:
1. Store Mark's and john's mass and height in variables
2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula (you can even implement both 
versions)
3. Create a Boolean variable 'markHigherBMI' containing information about 
whether Mark has a higher BMI than john.
Test data:
ยง Data 1: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. john weights 92 kg and is 1.95 
m tall.
ยง Data 2: Marks weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall. john weights 85 kg and is 1.76 
m tall.
GOOD LUCK  */

const markTall = 1.69;
const markWeight = 78;
const markHigherBMI = markWeight / (markTall * markTall);

const johnTall = 1.88;
const johnWeight = 95;
const johnHigherBMI = johnWeight / (johnTall * johnTall);

const validation = markHigherBMI > johnHigherBMI;
console.log(markHigherBMI, johnHigherBMI)
console.log(validation);

/*Use the BMI example from Challenge #1, and the code you already wrote, and 
improve it.
Your tasks:
1. Print a nice output to the console, saying who has the higher BMI. The message 
is either "Mark's BMI is higher than John's!" or "John's BMI is higher than Mark's!"
2. Use a template literal to include the BMI values in the outputs. Example: "Mark's
BMI (28.3) is higher than John's (23.9)!"
Hint: Use an if/else statement
