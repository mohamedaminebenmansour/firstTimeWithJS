//let's talk about values
/*value is basicaly a piece of data So it's the moost fundamental unit
of information that we have in programming*/
console.log("mohamed");//mohamed is a value
console.log(30);//30 is a value
//let's talk about variables
/*Now, one extremely useful thing we can do with values is to store them 
into variables and so this way we can reuse them over and over again */
let firstName = "mohamed";
/*so what we did here is called decalaring a variable and so this actually
create a real variable in my computer memory and we'll store this value
"mohamed" inside of this variable "firstName"*/
console.log(firstName)
let camelCase = "mohamed"; //use camelCase
//let 3years=3; //illegal variable name because starts with number
/*And in fact names can only contains numbers ,letters, unerscores(_) or
the dollar assign ($) */
//let med&amin="mohamed amin"; // illegl because we use "&"
//let new = "mohamed;" //illegal name a variable using a reserved JS keyword
let Person = "mohamed";//works but aanother convention we should not start a variable name with an upperCase
let PI = 3.14;/* this number is never gonna change 
and so that's a constant and for that, we have a conventin of writing it
in all upper case*/
